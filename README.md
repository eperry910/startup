# Revature Daily Check In Sheet Auto-Fill
## This application is meant to allow you to fill out the daily check in sheet for Revature
### Steps
1. Bring the main.py file onto your machine
2. Make sure that your Python has PyAutoGui installed. If it isn't, use the following command from your command line to install it: "pip install pyautogui"
3. Set a few variables in the Python code. Specifically, set the staging manager to the proper one, and set the path to your browser
4. (Optional) Add to startup. If you're on Windows, you can press WinKey + r, then type in "shell:startup" to access the startup folder for your Windows user. From here, just paste a shortcut to the file with the code and it will run on login
## Please Note: You may need to adjust the times spent for/in between each task, as computing speeds vary. The times I entered were fairly lenient, but some machines may still struggle
